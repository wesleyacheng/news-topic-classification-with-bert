**BREAKING NEWS: We are making a news topic classifier!**

Here we'll be doing transfer learning on [BERT](https://huggingface.co/distilbert-base-uncased) with the [AG News Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/ag_news) in PyTorch.

To try out the model without running the notebook, check out my inference endpoint at [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/wesleyacheng/news-topic-classification-with-bert).
